 You want it right, direct from hell, Spinal Tap!
--- Spinal Tap performs Tonight I'm Gonna Rock You Tonight ---

--- Tonight I’m Gonna Rock You Tonight (lyrics) ---

Little girl, it's a great big world but there's only one of me
You can't touch 'cause I cost too much but
Tonight I'm gonna rock you (Tonight I'm gunna rock you)
Yeah tonight I'm gonna rock you (Tonight I'm gunna rock you)
Tonight!
You're sweet but you're just four feet
And you still got your baby teeth
You're too young and I'm too well hung
Tonight I'm gonna rock you (Tonight I'm gunna rock you)
Yeah onight I'm gonna rock you (Tonight I'm gunna rock you)
Tonight!
Whoa yeah
You're hot, you take all we got, not a dry
seat in the house
Next day, we'll be on our way
Tonight we're gonna rock you (Tonight we're gunna rock you)
Yeah tonight we're gunna rock you (Tonight we're gunna rock
you)
Tonight!
Chorus:
Little girl, it's a great big world, but there's
only one of - meeeee
